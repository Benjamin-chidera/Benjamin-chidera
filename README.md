I'm a React developer dedicated to providing advanced web solutions using ReactJs technology. I am very passionate about improving my coding skills and developing applications and websites.

I began my journey as a front-end developer in 2023, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. I build web applications using modern technologies such as React, Tailwind, Bootstrap, Supabase, e.t.c.

Skills: HTML CSS, JS ReactJS, NextJS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, and Supabase
